## Final thoughts

This App was a useful tool to provide users with an easier way to issue their problems. It was designed and built in Visual Studio Code by using React Native. I used android studio and xcode to create virtual devices to deploy and launch the app for futher testing and publishing.

NOTE: Since using Expo Go instead of React Native CLI, there were a few dependencies and node modules that were required for this project which couldn't be implemented, such as, FileSystem, localStorage and basic HTML tags and elements. Due to the time constraints, Expo Go was the fastest and most effieient way for me to design, build, launch and deploy this app. If you have any questions, please reach out to me: sidguttula@yahoo.com
